                China declares all crypto-currency transactions illegal
            </h1>
            <p>
                <small>24 September</small>
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <img src="/Files/Image5.jpg" alt="A real-world coin designed with the Bitcoin logo lies scattered on a  table amid some miniature Chinese flags">
            </div>
            <p>
                China's central bank has announced that all transactions of crypto-currencies are illegal, effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Virtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities," the People's Bank of China said, warning it "seriously endangers the safety of people's assets".
            </p>
            <p>
                China is one of the world's largest crypto-currency markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fluctuations there often impact the global price of crypto-currencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The price of Bitcoin fell by more than $2,000 (Â£1,460) in the wake of the Chinese announcement.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is the latest in China's national crackdown on what it sees as a volatile, speculative investment at best - and a way to launder money at worst.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Trading crypto-currency has officially been banned in China since 2019, but has continued online through foreign exchanges.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there has been a significant crackdown this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                In May, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57169726">Chinese state intuitions warned buyers</a>they would have no protection for continuing to trade Bitcoin and other currencies online, as government officials vowed to increase pressure on the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                In June, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57549543">it told banks and payment platforms to stop facilitating transactions</a>and issued bans on "mining" the currencies - the trade of using powerful computers to make new coins.
            </p>

                Bitcoin explained: How do crypto-currencies work?
            </p>
                But Friday's announcement is the clearest indication yet that China wants to shut down crypto-currency trading in all its forms.
            <p>
                The statement makes clear that those who are involved in "illegal financial activities" are committing a crime and will be prosecuted.
            </p>
            <p>
                And foreign websites providing such services to Chinese citizens online is also an illegal activity, it said.

                Mining migration
            </h2>
            <p>
                The technology at the core of many crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin, relies on many distributed computers verifying and checking transactions on a giant shared ledger known as the blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a reward, new "coins" are randomly awarded to those who take part in this work - known as crypto "mining".
            </p>
            <p>
                China, with its relatively low electricity costs and cheaper computer hardware, has long been one of the world's main centres for mining.
            </p>
            <p>
                The activity is so popular there that gamers have sometimes blamed the industry for a global shortage of powerful graphics cards, which miners use for processing crypto-currencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Chinese crackdown has already hit the mining industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                In September 2019, China accounted for 75% of the world's Bitcoin energy use. By April 2021, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57811959">that had fallen to 46%</a>.
